# CI/CD Templates Repository

Welcome to the CI/CD My Templates Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my YAML files for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows.

## What is CI/CD?

*CI (Continuous Integration)* is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. CI ensures that each code change is automatically built, tested, and validated, making it easier to catch and fix issues early in the development process.

*CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)* extends CI by automating the deployment of code to different environments, such as staging and production. CD ensures that changes can be released to end-users quickly and reliably.
